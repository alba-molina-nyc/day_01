## Python Primitive Data Types

- strings
- integers

'Hello'[0] # to get a hold of the first value
```

***subscripting*** ⬅ pulling a particular item from the string

***integers*** aka whole numbers

```python

```python
print(3.1493)
```

***booleans*** used a lot in programs to test if something is true or false and your program responds accordingly

## Changing or Converting Data Types or TypeCasting

is where we change from particular data type to another

```python
num_char = len(input('what is your name?'))

new_num_char = str(num_char) 
print('your name has ' + new_num_char + ' characters')

print(type(num_char))
```
